Welcome to Unity with Git!

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS,
Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows. 
GitHub makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects.
GitHub also serves as a social networking site where developers can openly network, collaborate, and pitch their work.
